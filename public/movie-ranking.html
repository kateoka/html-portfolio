<h1>The Best Movies</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time.</h2>

<hr/>

<h3>The Shawshank Redemption</h3>
<p>It’s a deeply human story about hope, resilience, 
    and friendship, set against the grim backdrop of prison life.</p>

<h3>The Godfather</h3>
<p>Its storytelling, direction, and cinematography set a new benchmark for film.</p>

<h3>The Dark Knight</h3>
<p>It transformed the superhero film into 
    something more—blending action, philosophy, and moral ambiguity.</p>
